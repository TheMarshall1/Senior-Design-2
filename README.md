# Team GoGetters
### Purpose, Objective, Introduction:
The problem our team is trying to tackle is wandering in dementia patients. Alzheimer’s
disease or other dementia causes people to lose their ability to recognize familiar places and
faces. It’s common for grandparents living with dementia to wander or become lost or confused
about their location, and it can happen at any stage of the disease. Although common,
wandering can be dangerous and the stress of this risk weighs heavily on caregivers and family.
### Solution:
The project is designed to give the patient around the clock care. It is a sensor system
consisting of two boards. First, a weight sensor that is located under the patient mattress and
motion sensor near the bed work together to collect and analyze data with an Arduino
microcontroller. Second, an IR sensor that is able to tell if the patient is leaving the room. The
code reads the input from the sensors on each of the two Arduinos (Client Arduino and Server
Arduino) and notifies the server Arduino directly or over wifi from the client Arduino. Then the
server Arduino changes the webpage to notify the user.
Scope:
Continuing from our first semester prototype, our team will focus on achieving the goals
defined in the Tasks and Deliverables section. This document will keep track of the task needed
to be done .
